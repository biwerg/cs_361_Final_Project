            <h4> We are tasked with building a weather app that has the ability to give the end-users up to date information about local weather forecasts. Our requirements for the weather app are the result of research and development, aimed at meeting the needs of users who require quick and reliable weather updates without having a cluttered interface. In order to ensure that our app meets the needs of our target audience, we conducted a semi-structured interview with a customer. The purpose of this interview was to gather insights into what users want from a weather app, what features are most important to them, and how they typically use weather apps in their daily lives. As part of our requirement-gathering process, we have defined the scope and boundaries of the project. This includes identifying the key features that our app will offer, such as real-time updates, a simple UI/UX design, and weather forecasts. We have also determined the limitations of the app, such as its reliance on external data sources and the need for an internet connection. Overall, our weather app aims to provide users with a convenient and reliable way to stay informed about weather conditions in their area to ensure that our users always have access to the information they need to plan their day with confidence.</h4>
